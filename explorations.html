        <h1>What I Learned</h1>
        <p> 
            During both the video game and board game I learned the complex steps of making simple games. 
            It gave me a new understanding on how games are made and how much go into it. Just to make a 
            simple game with rules it takes a lot and thats not even mentioning making it fun. After making the rules 
            I found that both the games were playable but weren't that fun. When making a game you have to think of the 
            different factors like difficulty, enjoyment, and characters.

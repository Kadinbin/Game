        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Kadin Biney and I am 16 years old. 
            I go to The University of Science Magnet School.
            In my free time I like to play basketball and video games. 
        </p>
        <h2> My Definition of Game</h2> 
        <p> A game is an activity with a set of rules made so everyone has fun</p>
        <h2>My Gamer Type</h2>
        <p> The gamer types that I thought I would be were killer and explorer because I like to both fight and see the world. 
            The gamer types I actually ended up being were 87% Killer, 47% Socialiser, 40% Explorer, and 27% Achiever. (KSEA)</p>
        <h2> My Favorite Game</h2>
        <p> My favorite game is monopoly. This is because monopoly is a good family game. 
            Alot of time people don't want to play monopoly with me though because it is a long game
